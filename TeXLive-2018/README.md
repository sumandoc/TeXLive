Also contains [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) and [ImageMagickÂ®](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) for image manipulation to include in TeX files.

## How to get the image?

From the interactive docker shell, pull this image with:

`docker pull sumankhanal/texlive-2018:<tag>`

## Why should you use it?

If you work with Latex documents, this is useful to compile your document **independent of OS and without the need to install anything**.  All the compilers: **pdflatex**, **xelatex** and **lualatex** are available in images with tag `small` and `full`.


## How to run this image/ How do you use it ?

After you are done with the pull, mount the directory present in your host operating system containing .tex files 
into docker image like this:

`docker run -it -v /c/Users/username/Folder_with_tex:/home -w /home sumankhanal/texlive-2018:<tag> bin/bash`


You will now have access to the terminal. Your working dir will be `/home` where you will see the .tex files.

Now run:
`pdflatex -shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode yourtex.tex` and see your **yourtex.tex** file getting compiled.

**The size of image is 4 GB** which is quite big but
its ***cool*** with all stuff that's available in **CTAN**. :)

For compiling your [beamer slides](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) and thesis, image with `small` tag is adequate, or you can install `beamer` and `minted` packages with command `tlmgr install beamer minted` in image with `basic` tag. This way pulling image will be faster with less space consumption.
